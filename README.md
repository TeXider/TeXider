Hi, I'm TeXider. I'm very interested in mathematics, which led me to programming. I'm currently quite advanced in C#, but I also like C++ and Java. I enjoy
creating games and applications, but I prefer the algorithms part, because what fascinates me in a program is its mathematical logic part. I am also passionate about quantum 
physics and the structure of microprocessors, having a very strong link with quantum physics.
